The [Machine Learning for the Web Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webmachinelearning) has been launched.

The mission of the Machine Learning for the Web Community Group (WebML CG) is to make Machine Learning a first-class web citizen by incubating and developing a dedicated low-level Web API for machine learning inference in the browser. Please see the [charter](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/charter) for more information.

The group invites browser engine developers, hardware vendors, web application developers, and the broader web community with interest in Machine Learning to participate.
